                <p> We propose 2 game modes. Player 1 vs Player 2 and AI challenge. </p> <br>
                <p>
                    Both games will have players alternatively plaving their marker on the board. 
                    The player starting is randomly chosen at the beginning of each round and 
                    the winner is decided on the best out of 3 rounds.
