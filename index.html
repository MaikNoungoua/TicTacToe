                <p> <strong>Tic-Tac-Toe </strong> is an ancient game that billions of people have played over the course of history. 
                    While some experts believe the game dates back to the ancient Egyptians, 
                    others believe it evolved from an ancient Roman game called Terni Lapilli.

                <p>The modern game we know as tic-tac-toe is played on a nine-square grid 
                    created by drawing lines to create 
                    three horizontal rows and three vertical columns. With X going first, 
                    players alternate marking the squares with Xs and Os, 
                    trying to achieve three marks in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

                    Tic-tac-toe is interesting to mathematicians, 
                    because its small grid and simple game play can be used to teach simple mathematical principles, 
                    such as probability. 
                    For example, did you realize that there are <strong>362,800 unique ways to place Xs and Os into the grid?</strong>

                <p>
                    Of those combinations, <strong>255,168</strong> of them are possible winning combinations. 
                    However, if you eliminate all the symmetrical combinations, 
                    there are only 138 unique winning combinations. 
                    With this few winning combinations, tic-tac-toe is a relatively easy game to play, 
                    making it popular with children. 
                    Most players quickly learn that two good tic-tac-toe players will settle into playing to a draw repeatedly.
